He suggests finding a \"Champion of Fear\" who can teach them to be great cowards so they can fly, making them invincible. He hatches a secret plan to seize power and tells the chief they'll find the Champion of Fear in Gaul. The Vikings later experience real fear when they hear a ballad sung by Cacofonix. When Asterix asks him what fear is good for, Getafix explains that we can only be courageous when we have some kind of fear to overcome. Cryptograf's plan involves capturing the Champion of Fear and claiming the prize of anything he wants, which Cryptograf says is the chief's daughter, Abba. Since the chief has no son, this would put Olaf in line to become the next chief (with Cryptograf calling the shots, of course). Olaf captures Justforkix, and Asterix and Obelix have to retrieve him before the next full moon when his father, Doublehelix, plans to return to their village. Asterix and Obelix arrive on Iceland shortly after the Vikings, but they can't rescue Justforkix. He doesn't want to leave because he considers the Vikings (especially Abba) as his friends. However, the Vikings decide to test Justforkix's flying skills by throwing him off a cliff. Cryptograf secretly rigs up a rope to Justforkix, allowing him to be suspended in the foggy air and thus convincing the Vikings that he really can fly.\n", "hybrid": "Cryptograf says the enemies always disappear because \"Fear gives them wings\".
