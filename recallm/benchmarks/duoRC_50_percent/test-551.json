As a former Mormon missionary, Cowan was shocked that a church that practices alternative marriage (polygamy) would be so vehemently against marriage equality. He collected secret recordings, documents, and footage exposing the Mormon Church's actions and discrimination against LGBT individuals. The documentary \"8: The Mormon Proposition\" explores these issues and sheds light on the Mormon Church's campaigns against LGBT rights. Cowan's goal was to raise awareness and encourage action to protect human rights and prevent similar election shams in the future.\n", "hybrid": "Director Reed Cowan switched his focus to Mormon ideology because he was appalled by the involvement of the Mormon Church in the marriage debate, considering their own history of practicing alternative marriage (polygamy).
