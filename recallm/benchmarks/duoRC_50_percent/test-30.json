Honey boards TAAC Flight 26 to Montreal by way of Gander, Newfoundland, which is a Reindeer. Honey tries to press Captain Samuelson to turn back, because if he does not, the tail will break off and everyone on board will die. The tail group was never found. Honey's experiment had not failed, but simply took longer than he calculated because he ran it in a heated shed, and that his own airliner had made it to Gander because it had piled up its flying hours serving a tropical route.
