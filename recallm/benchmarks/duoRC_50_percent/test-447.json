It is a stable compound and does not possess explosive properties. However, it can be used as a component in the production of certain explosives or propellants, where it may contribute to the detonation of the overall mixture. The specific conditions and formulations in which hexamethylene may detonate would depend on the particular explosive or propellant being produced.", "vectordb": "The hexamethylene detonates when a particular sonic frequency is broadcasted to trigger it. It is a form of explosive crystal that has 80 times more explosive power than C-4. The crystal can be used to create a necklace or be inserted into a musical instrument, such as a trumpet, to serve as a trigger. The detonation of the hexamethylene is part of a larger plan orchestrated by the computer system ARIIA to eliminate the President and other members of the executive branch of the government.\n", "hybrid": "The hexamethylene detonates when a particular sonic frequency is broadcasted to trigger it.
