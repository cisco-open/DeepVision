Some common causes of lifeboat capsizing include:\n\n1. Rough weather conditions: Severe storms, high winds, and large waves can cause lifeboats to capsize. The force of the water can overturn the boat, especially if it is not properly secured or if the waves are particularly powerful.\n\n2. Improper loading or weight distribution: If the weight inside the lifeboat is not evenly distributed, it can lead to instability and potential capsizing. Unevenly distributed weight can cause the boat to tilt to one side, making it more susceptible to capsizing.\n\n3. Collisions or impacts: Lifeboats can capsize if they collide with other vessels, rocks, or other objects in the water. The impact can cause the boat to lose balance and overturn.\n\n4. Improper launching or recovery: During the process of launching or recovering lifeboats, if proper procedures are not followed, it can result in capsizing. Mishandling the boat or incorrect use of equipment can lead to instability and potential capsizing.\n\n5. Mechanical failures: If there are mechanical issues with the lifeboat, such as malfunctioning engines or steering systems, it can lead to loss of control and potential capsizing.\n\nIt is important to note that lifeboats are designed to be stable and resistant to capsizing under normal conditions. However, in extreme circumstances or when proper safety protocols are not followed, they can still be at risk of capsizing.", "vectordb": "The lifeboats are not capsized in the document.\n", "hybrid": "Lifeboats can be capsized in various ways, typically due to external factors or human error.
