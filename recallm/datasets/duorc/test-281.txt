PARAGRAPH
The story revolves in the background of Mount Academy School, where three girls, Gouri and two others were found dead. The deaths seemed to be suicide. After some time, all the people in the school return to a normal stage.
A girl, Parvathy, newly joins the school who is the niece of Sreekanth, the Commissioner of Police, who is probing the death case. Parvathy lives in the same room where Gouri lived. After some days, the vengeful spirit of Gouri appears in front of Parvathy, to help her to take revenge from the people who killed her. Parvathy becomes friendly to the spirit soon.
Now Gouri starts telling her story how she had doting parents, best friends and a peaceful life. All this was interrupted when Aloshy, the dance teacher of the three dead girls, takes naked pictures through hidden cameras. Aloshy, at several occasions, blackmailed these girls to leak these pictures in the internet. The girls are frightened now as Aloshy always wanted to have sex with these girls.
One fine day, these girls are about to reveal everything to the teachers, but Aloshy and his lover kill these girls. The two girls were dead, but Gouri didn't die instantly. He pours more of the poison in Gouri's mouth, and finally kills her.
In the meanwhile, Parvathy starts to behave like Gouri, which turns everybody in horror. They call an exorcist, who says that Gouri's vengeful spirit has entered Parvathy's body.
Gouri, years after her death, is back to kill Aloshy and his lover. She succeeds in killing both of them. Gouri puts fire in Aloshy's lover's room and kills her, turning her body beyond recognition, and she pushes off Aloshy from the terrace of his house and kills him.
Gouri's spirit now finds peace and bades goodbye to Parvathy, leaving her sad.
