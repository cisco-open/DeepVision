PARAGRAPH
Sai Moon-Kin (Tsui) is a rich man who lives with his concubines and his son and a daughter named Yiau (Loletta Lee), who is raised like a boy and is ignorant of the ways of love. Because her brother is mentally retarded, Yiau wants to be her father's heir but feels that she needs to go to school for the required education. Her desire to attend school leads her to a love affair with a lustful young scholar (Ken Lok). Only after she is equipped by a protective chastity belt, does her father let Yiau go to school, guised in drag.
Sai Moon finds his son's new wife Siu-Tsui (Shu Qi) attractive. He does not realize that she is the evil Mirage Lady, who knows "sucking" magic. Yiau and the Iron Man (Ben Ng) try to stop the Mirage Lady from harming any more people.
