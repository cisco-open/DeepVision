PARAGRAPH
Filmed in Portland, Oregon, What the Bleep Do We Know!? presents a viewpoint of the physical universe and human life within it, with connections to neuroscience and quantum physics. Some ideas discussed in the film are:

That the universe is best seen as constructed from thought (or ideas) rather than from matter.
That "empty space" is not empty.
That matter is not solid, and electrons are able to pop in and out of existence without it being known where they disappear to.
That beliefs about who one is and what is real are a direct cause of oneself and of one's own realities.
That peptides produced by the brain can cause a bodily reaction to emotion.
In the narrative segments of the movie, Marlee Matlin portrays Amanda, a photographer who plays the role of everywoman as she experiences her life from startlingly new and different perspectives.
In the documentary segments of the film, interviewees discuss the roots and meaning of Amanda's experiences. The comments focus primarily on a single theme: "We create our own reality." The director, William Arntz, has described What the Bleep as a movie for the "metaphysical left".[2]
