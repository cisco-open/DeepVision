## Activity

* **CHAD**: Charlotte Anomaly Dataset [2023]
  * CHAD is high-resolution, multi-camera dataset for surveillance video anomaly detection. It includes bounding box, Re-ID, and pose annotations, as well as frame-level anomaly labels, dividing all frames into two groups of anomalous or normal.

## Image Datasets

*  **VFP290K**: A Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset for Vision-based **Fallen Person Detection**. 
   * Vision-based Fallen Person (VFP290K) is a novel, large-scale dataset for the detection of fallen persons composed of fallen person images collected in various real-world scenarios. VFP290K consists of 294,714 frames of fallen persons extracted from 178 videos, including 131 scenes in 49 locations.

*  **Street Scene** [2020]
   * Street Scene consists of 46 training and 35 testing high resolution 1280×720 video sequences taken from a USB camera overlooking a scene of a two-lane street with bike lanes and pedestrian sidewalks during daytime. There are a total of 56,847 frames for training and 146,410 frames for testing, extracted from the original videos at 15 frames per second. The dataset contains a total of 205 naturally occurring anomalous events ranging from illegal activities such as jaywalking and illegal U-turns to simply those that do not occur in the training set such as pets being walked and a metermaid ticketing a car.
